Welcome to the Heliverse Internship Assignment project! This application is built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Next UI. It is designed to fulfill the requirements of the internship assignment provided by Heliverse. Below are the key functionalities of the application:

## Features

1. **Display Users in Cards Format with Pagination**: Users are displayed in visually appealing card format with pagination. Each page displays 20 users.

2. **Search by Name**: Users can search for other users by their names. As the user types in the search input, the list of displayed users dynamically updates to match the search query.

3. **Filters**: Implement three filters - Domain, Gender, and Availability. Users can select multiple filters simultaneously to refine the displayed user list.

4. **Create a Team**: Users can create a team by selecting users from the list. Only users with unique domains and availability are selectable for the team, similar to adding items to a cart in e-commerce websites.

5. **Show Team Details**: Once the team is created, the application displays the details of the team, including the selected users' information.

6. **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and displays properly on different screen sizes.
